            During my engineering journal as an undergraduate, intern, and graduate student,
            I have been on many projects both academically from course projects to industry projects from internships
            and research endeavors.
            Below are lists of the projects with the resulting repositories to github pages if applicable. Additionally, more projects are available on my github <a href=https://github.com/CrustlessLoaf>here</a>

            <h4>Second Year: Door Opener</h4>
            <p>
                In the second year project course, the aim of the project was to create a system which uses a number of
                sensors and a number of actuators.
                My group and I developed a Door Opener which could be controlled via IR remote or by student card
                access. The code for the project in arduino as well as
                the project presentation is available at my github <a

            <h4>Third Year: Welder Power Supply</h4>
            <p>
                During the third year of engineering, the project course was a welder based project course which had the
                project revolve around the resistance spot welding
                and switched mode power supplies. It was sincerly a terribly organised course, however in the end our
                device did perform.
                Our power supply to the unit performed and used PID control to stablize a constant voltage for the spot
                weld process. The arduino code and
                project report is available on my github <a
                    href="https://github.com/CrustlessLoaf/Welder_Power_Supply/">here</a>

            <h4>Internship Year</h4>
            <p>
                During my internship I had many electrical project that consisted of updating electrical drawingsa in
                autoCAD, working with milwrights, electricians, and/or contractors
                to work on plant projects such as: ESA violation fixes, lighting installations, quality check stations
                with recorded backups, and more.
                The most significant project was a PLC project that I programmed from scratch. In essenece the project
                was to lock and unlock items during a break period and to stop the
                assembly line if the box was not closed/open before/after a break or shift change respectively. This
                project was successful and I was very proud of it. I
                also had to collaborate with a GM team in texas to get an ANDON display to display properly. This is
                known as cross-function teamwork.

            <h4>Capstone Project: Smart Cane System</h4>
            <p>
                During the final year engineers are tasked with creating a capstone project. My group was comprised of
                great peers that I met during my first, second, and internship years.
                The project that we chose was to create a smart cane system for the elderly. The problem was, when
                elderly loved ones fall or get lost in the case of dimenia,
                they may be out and about. This smart cane's goal was to alert family members in the event of a fall or
                lost event. The method was to utilize a push button or gyroscope (fall sensor)
                activated event which would send text alerts to loved ones. The text would be either notifying a push
                button or fall event with a google maps link to where the elderly family member'
                current location. The project was successfull and the code and report will be available soon.

            <h4>First research paper</h4>
            <p>
                During my first year of my masters degree I gained enough knowledge to create a novel idea, simulate,
                and publish my first paper with my supervising professor.
                This paper was presented at PIMRC 2023 and is available for viewing <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293935">here</a>.
