            I cherish you for the woman you are, and who you are called to be with me. You are so beautiful, caring, loving, smart and observant.

            I love you for many reasons. I love how cute you are. How innocent you are. I love how you look up to me. I love how much you care.
            I love that you give yourself to me. I love that you have a head on your shoulder. And I love how you need me and make it known. And for so many others.
