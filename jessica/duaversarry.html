            <p> Happy Anniversarry my lovely baby. <br> The past two year have been a lovely experience with you. When I
                break our official anniversary down from two years to 24 months it seems so short.
                I've only been your boyfriend for 104 weeks, 731 days, 17,544 hours, 1,052,640 minutes, or 63,158,400
                seconds which seems so short in this way.
                I cherish you for the woman you are, and who you are called to be with me. You are beautiful both inside
                and out, being full of love, care, and commitment. You are quick and
                vigilent, cute and gentle. You are a beatiful and rare flower of the field &#128536.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="beginning">
            <p>
                The reasons I love you form a never ending list, that cannot be counted nor read in its entirety. I love
                how cute you are. I love how pure you are. I love your laugh.
                I love your smile. I love your hair. I love your humour. I love your eyes. I love the way you lay around
                and on me.
                I love how much you care about us. I love that we make eachother our priority. I love that you listen to
                me. I love that you respect me.
                I love that you have a good head on your shoulder. I love that you conitnue to be a good girl. And for
                so many others.
