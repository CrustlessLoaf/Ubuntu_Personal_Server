            Every year together draws our hearts closer
            <br>
            Every day apart makes us stronger
            <br>
            Every minute with you is cherrished
            <br>
            Every second with you is pure
            <br>
            Whether its interpreted as fait, God, or some invisible 
            <br>
            thread woven through the universe, we met at exactly 
            <br>
            the right time, in the right moment, and 
            <br>
            without you, I wouldn't be the man I am today. <br>You are an amazing, beautiful, smart, and loving 
            <br>
            Woman. I cherish and love you so very much, 
            <br>
            more than english is capable of explaining. 
            <br>
            There is noone else I would ever want, 
            <br>
            Not in this world, 
            <br>
            Not in this universe, 
            <br>
            Nor in anything beyond this. 
            <br>
            I love how we are together, 
            <br>
            How we grow together, 
            <br>
            How we're there for eachother, 
            <br>
            How we look toward our future hand in hand, 
            <br>
            For every moment God has gifted me with you, 
            <br>
            I am truely grateful. 
            <br> You are the love of my life, <br>
            I love you Jessica &#10084;&#65039;
